```

### 2.2 Data Models

#### 2.2.1 Resume Entity
```python
class Resume(BaseModel):
    ID: str
    Resume_str: str
    Resume_html: Optional[str]
    Category: str
    char_len: int
    parsed_json: Optional[str]  # LLM-parsed structured data
    # Additional metadata fields...
```

#### 2.2.2 Resume Parsing and Structuring

To enhance matching accuracy and enable structured data analysis, our system employs advanced language model parsing to convert unstructured resume text into structured JSON format.

##### LLM-Based Resume Parsing
- **Model**: GPT-4-mini for cost-effective yet accurate parsing
- **Output Format**: Structured JSON containing:
  - Personal information (name, contact details)
  - Professional summary
  - Work experience (with dates, companies, roles, responsibilities)
  - Education (degrees, institutions, dates)
  - Skills (technical and soft skills)
  - Certifications and achievements
  - Projects and portfolio items

##### Parsing Methodology
```python
def parse_resume_with_llm(resume_text: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Parse unstructured resume text into structured JSON using GPT-4-mini
    """
    prompt = """
    Parse the following resume into structured JSON format with sections:
    - personal_info: {name, email, phone, location}
    - summary: professional summary text
    - experience: [{company, role, start_date, end_date, responsibilities}]
    - education: [{institution, degree, field, graduation_date}]
    - skills: {technical: [], soft: []}
    - certifications: []
    - projects: [{name, description, technologies}]
    """
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}\n\nResume:\n{resume_text}"}]
    )
    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

This structured parsing enables more precise matching across different resume sections and provides enhanced data quality for downstream processing.

#### 2.2.3 Job Description Entity
```python
class JobDescription(BaseModel):
    id: str
    Position: str
    Long_Description: str
    Company_Name: str
    Exp_Years: Optional[str]
    # Additional requirement fields...
```

## 3. Individual Matcher Components

### 3.1 General Matcher

The General Matcher evaluates overall semantic compatibility between resume content and job descriptions using advanced natural language processing techniques.

#### 3.1.1 Methodology

##### Text Preprocessing and Identifier Removal
Our preprocessing pipeline implements comprehensive text cleaning to ensure fair and privacy-preserving similarity computation:

- **Personal Identifier Removal**: Systematic removal of personally identifiable information including:
  - Names (using spaCy Named Entity Recognition for PERSON entities)
  - Email addresses (regex pattern matching)
  - Phone numbers (pattern-based detection)
  - Addresses (location entity extraction)
  - Company-specific identifiers and references
- **Text Normalization**: Standardization of text format, whitespace, and encoding
- **Noise Reduction**: Removal of formatting artifacts, special characters, and irrelevant content

##### Semantic Similarity Computation
- **Embedding Generation**: Utilization of pre-trained sentence transformer models (`all-mpnet-base-v2`)
- **Cosine Similarity**: Mathematical similarity computation between high-dimensional embeddings
- **Score Normalization**: Conversion to interpretable percentage scores (0-100 scale)

The preprocessing ensures that similarity computation focuses on professional qualifications and job-relevant content rather than personal identifiers, promoting fair evaluation across all candidates.

#### 3.1.2 Technical Implementation

##### Comprehensive PII Removal Process
```python
def _remove_pii(self, text: str) -> str:
    """
    Comprehensive removal of personally identifiable information
    """
    # Load spaCy model for NER
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
    doc = nlp(text)
    
    # Remove named entities (PERSON, ORG-specific references)
    tokens = []
    for token in doc:
        if token.ent_type_ in ['PERSON']:
            tokens.append('[PERSON]')  # Replace with placeholder
        elif token.ent_type_ in ['EMAIL']:
            tokens.append('[EMAIL]')
        elif token.ent_type_ in ['PHONE']:
            tokens.append('[PHONE]')
        else:
            tokens.append(token.text)
    
    cleaned_text = ' '.join(tokens)
    
    # Additional regex-based cleaning
    cleaned_text = re.sub(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', '[EMAIL]', cleaned_text)
    cleaned_text = re.sub(r'\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b', '[PHONE]', cleaned_text)
    
    return cleaned_text
```

##### Core Matching Algorithm
```python
def compute_score(self) -> float:
    """
    Compute semantic similarity score between resume and job description
    """
    # Comprehensive PII and identifier removal
    resume_clean = self._remove_pii(self.match.resume.Resume_str)
    job_clean = self._remove_pii(self.match.job_description.Long_Description)
    
    # Additional text normalization
    resume_clean = self._normalize_text(resume_clean)
    job_clean = self._normalize_text(job_clean)
    
    # Generate high-dimensional semantic embeddings
    resume_embedding = self.model.encode([resume_clean])
    job_embedding = self.model.encode([job_clean])
    
    # Compute cosine similarity in embedding space
    similarity = cosine_similarity(resume_embedding, job_embedding)[0][0]
    
    # Convert to percentage score with bounds checking
    score = max(0.0, min(100.0, float(similarity * 100)))
    
    return score

def _normalize_text(self, text: str) -> str:
    """
    Additional text normalization for improved matching
    """
    # Remove extra whitespace and normalize formatting
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text.strip())
    
    # Remove special formatting characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\.\,\;\:\!\?]', ' ', text)
    
    return text
```

This implementation ensures that similarity computation is based purely on professional content and qualifications, eliminating potential bias from personal identifiers while maintaining the semantic richness of the professional information.

        return 100.0  # No specific requirement
    
    if candidate_years >= required_years:
        return 100.0  # Meets or exceeds requirement
    else:
        return (candidate_years / required_years) * 100  # Proportional score
```
